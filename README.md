Ever wanted to experiment on and customize a webpage ? The **Pimp my page engine** let's you do just that.
The engine leverage the mighty [BrowserSync](https://www.browsersync.io/) to allow full HTML, CSS or JS modifications on any webpage. 

* write SASS, it's automatically compiled to CSS and injected in the page (no refresh needed)
* write JS, the browser's refresh with your custom JS injected
* write some HTML and jQuery like operations to swap/modify the page content
